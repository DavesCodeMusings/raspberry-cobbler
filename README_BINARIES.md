# Precompiled arm64 binaries
You will find files here with names like _program_.arm64.tar.gz. These are compiled versions of the programs used in the guide. So, if you're not able to get cross-compiling working with the Ubuntu virtual machine, you can still follow along.

You will need some sort of Linux machine to extract the files, because Windows cannot handle the symbolic links used.

For licensing information, see the /usr/share/doc directory in each package.
